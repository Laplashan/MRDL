## Introduction

_Welcome everyone:wave:_

MRDL was born from the necessity of getting a better undarstanding of the dynamics of our car. The motivation behind this repository is an exploration into the world of DIY electronics, the end goal being to create a functional prototype that can be permanently mounted on our MR23C.
The data logging system consists of four key aspects:
Firmware, this program is flashed onto the micro-controller so as to control its general operation and communicate with the server software.
Server software, this program exposes various API endpoints which handle hardware registration, configuration and telemetry.
Client software, this program is the source code for a web based interface for hardware reporting and configuration. (Currently using Blynk)

## Objective and needs (Constantly updating)

To get a better understanding of our car we need to be able to read data from various sectors, wich can include temperature, speed, position, acceleration, impacts, etc.
In this section, we´ll add a quick list mencioning de key spots to get data from, and what sensor/implement can be used to get data 
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. In this case, the name must be `my-first-branch` to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
